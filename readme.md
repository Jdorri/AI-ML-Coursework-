| Machine learning for imaging | An age regression pipeline using volumetric, pre-processed, and raw pixel features extracted from brain MRI data.| Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, SimpleITK |
| Machine translation | Developing regression models (non-neural, recurrent, transformer) to predict the quality of machine-translated sentences. | Python, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Transformers |
| Neural networks | Designing a low-level neural network library, using a neural network to predict insurance claims, and competing in a simulated AI market. | Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras |

## Usage 

Accompanying data files and additional utility scripts have been left out. The goal is rather to demonstrate experience and achievement.
